Owing to its characteristics, it is used as a hedging tool or can act as a safe haven in turmoil conditions. This project aimed at exploring the relationship of gold price exported between two years, 2018 and 2019. At the end of the project graphical prediction results are realized. To forecast gold price, in the following year, a machine-learning algorithm called ARIMA is employed. 

Feture improvements could include, use of deep learning models like LSTM to compare the results, a dashboard can also be developed for realtime predictions.
